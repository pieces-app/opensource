# Open Source by Pieces (OSP)

> A great place to get started is our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/getpieces) where all the community members communicate daily.

Welcome to our Open Source Hub, where you can build your own Pieces Copilot, use your own Local Large Language Models(LLLMs), reference your own context in Copilot Chats, and save code using an incredibly flexible database all together with the community.

Our goal is to bring the power of offline Contextual Copilots even closer to your workflow, and have provided [Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) as a resource for you to use in any application you are developing on or a platform via our SDKs.

> [Contribute to a Repo](/#Projects), open an issue or visit our [general documentation](https://docs.pieces.app) and learn about Pieces to help add to the conversation on how we can apply the power of Pieces OS (via our SDKs) in the products and locations we currently work.

## SDKs
Build on top of Pieces OS with this SDK and create your own Contextual Copilot. We recommend downloading the package via NPM/Maven/PyPI where you can find directions on how to use the APIs inside of this package.

This package is easy to add to your project and gives you immediate access to all features in Pieces OS. You can always demo all of the available functionality that is present for you to use by downloading [Pieces for Developers Desktop App and Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing).

## Playgrounds

These are environments for building and understanding the SDKs wholisticaly, using all of the available features in the client and see real world examples similar to how we have build our products.

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| 🛝 [Typescript Example Playground](https://github.com/pieces-app/example-typescript) | Using the client with NPM to develop on in a web environment. Great HTML, CSS, and JS examples of different functionality. |

## Simple Starter Projects

These examples are very focused, and show a specific feature/set of endpoints off. These are great for starting a project around, and can be useful for finding less cluttered examples that have fewer pending changes.

| Project | Description | Links |
|---|---|---|
| 🍦 [Simple Copilot Starter](https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-copilot-vanilla-typescript-example) |  See how you can use the Copilot by itself using a few endpoints and a WebSocket. Follow this here to see how you can stream in the conversation with your copilot. There are a few blogs written/being written to assist and guide you as you explore the Pieces Copilot. | [(Blog + Tutorial) Build Your Own Copilot in 10 Minutes](https://code.pieces.app/blog/build-your-own-open-source-copilot-with-pieces) |
